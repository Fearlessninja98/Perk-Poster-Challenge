- "root directory" is your Black Ops 3 install ( example : C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Call of Duty Black Ops III )
- Troubleshooting steps can be found at the bottom of this file

#################
# WARNING ##
#################

- If you have Madgaz's VERRUCKT (DLC5 ZOMBIE CHRONICLES) model pack installed, you will have duplicate GDT's issues and your map will not compile!
- This is easy to fix! Simply DO NOT copy the 'model_export' and 'source_data' folders. Since you already have the Verruckt models, you don't need these.

# 			INSTRUCTIONS			 #
##########################################################

##########
# STEP 1 #
##########

- Open the download, and copy all the files to your root directory. (See above note about Madgaz's model packs)

- This will add all the models, textures, scripts, and prefabs that you need to your mod tools.

##########
# STEP 2 #
##########

- Open YOURMAPNAME.gsc

- find this line :

	#using scripts\zm\zm_usermap;

- add this underneath :

	#using scripts\zm\zm_perk_poster_challenge;

##########
# STEP 3 #
##########

- Go to your map folder ( right click your map in launcher and select "Open Map Folder" )

- open the "zone_source" folder

- open YOURMAPNAME.zone

- find these lines:

	scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/YOURMAPNAME.gsc
	scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/YOURMAPNAME.csc

- add this directly underneath

	scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_perk_poster_challenge.gsc

##########
# STEP 4 #
##########

- Open your map in radiant
- In the Prefab Browser, navigate to the 'perk_poster_prefabs'
- Place at least one poster for each perk included. (Juggernog, Quick Revive, Double Tap, Speed Cola)
- Then place as many perk posters as you like through your map. (I recommend 4 of each poster, but there is (theoretically) no limit)
- Compile your map.

- The script will randomly choose one of each type of poster to keep in your map, 
  when any player finds and shoots all four posters, the perk limit will go up by one.

- The prefabs are located at - map_source/_prefabs/perk_poster_prefabs

##########################################################

Q : The perk limit is not increasing even after finding and shooting the posters?
A : You likely have not added the minimum of one of each type of perk poster to your map.

Q : I'm getting "Error linking script 'scripts/zm/YOURMAPNAME.gsc'" error message when compiling?
A : You have not linked the .zone file properly. Go back to Step #3.

Q : All the posters are still in my map and are not reacting to being shot?
A : You have not added the script to your .gsc file properly. Go back to Step #2.

Q : I get conflict/duplicate GDT errors when I build my map? I can no longer open APE?
A : If you are using Madgaz's Verruckt pack (or anyone else's or ported them yourself), you already have the posters included. Remove the GDT file included in this pack found at 'source_data\p7_zm_asylum_perk_posters.gdt'


Happy modding!
